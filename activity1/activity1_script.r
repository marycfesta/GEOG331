# 6 raised to the 6 power
6^6

# 5 plus 210
5 + 210

# 3 minus 10
3 - 10

# name my number
a <- 2446
# multiply my number by 5
a * 5

# make a vector of numbers
b <- c(2446,40,10000)
# divide all numbers by 2
b/2

### QUESTION 3 ###

# create a vector of 4 numbers
fourvect <- c(2,4,6,8)
# square all of these numbers
fourvect^2

# multiply 3 by 4 and then divide by 2
(3 * 4) / 2

# create a vector of 6 numbers
sixvect <- c(3,6,9,12,15,19)
# divide all of these numbers by 3
sixvect / 3
